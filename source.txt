The concept of a function is one of the most important ones in mathematics.
A common usage of functions in computer languages is to implement mathematical functions.
Such a function is computing one or more results, which are entirely determined by the parameters passed to it.

In the most general sense, a function is a structuring element in programming languages to group a set of statements so they can be utilized more than once in a program. The only way to accomplish this without functions would be to reuse code by copying it and adapt it to its different context.
Using functions usually enhances the comprehensibility and quality of the program. It also lowers the cost for development and maintenance of the software.
